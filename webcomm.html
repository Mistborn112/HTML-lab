        <h2>My Favourite Books</h2>
        <ol>

            <li>The Lane Winslow murder mystery series by Iona Whishaw </ul>
        <p>This series single handedly sparked my love for reading so it holds a special place in my heart</p>
            <li>As Long As The Lemon Trees Grow by Zoulfa Katouh</ul>
                <p>This book was unbelievably sad and heartwrenching but it was so beautiful and i will never get over it.</p>
        
            <li>The Poppy War Trilogy by R.F. Kuang</ul>
                <p>this trilogy is all about war, genocide, torture and drug abuse and the author really doesn't sugar coat any of it which makes these books kind of hard to read but they were written so well and are definitely some of the best books i've ever read.</p>
            <li>The Gentlemen Bastards Trilogy by Scott Lynch</li>
            <p>these books are dark and funny and the characters are great</p>
            <li>The Farseer Trilogy by Robin Hobb</li>
            <p>These books are all about assassins, magic and a boatload of political intrigue and the author put so much detail and care into every word that it made me want stop reading so it never ends. i stared at the wall for like 5 minutes after i finished the last book because it was so great.</p>
        
        </ol>
        <h2>My Favourite Games</h2>
        <ol>

            <li>Elden Ring</ul>
                <p>This game was absolute prefection in every way from the story to the bosses to the characters, this is my favorite game of all time 10/10 would recommend</p>
            <li>Baldur's Gate 1 and 3</ul>
                <p>I really like the story, characters and gameplay of the D&D games and how easy it is to immerse yourself in the world as you play</p>
            <li>Slime Rancher</ul>
                <p>This game is so silly Literally all i have to do is take care of funky slimes and explore but i think its simplicity is what makes it so great</p>
